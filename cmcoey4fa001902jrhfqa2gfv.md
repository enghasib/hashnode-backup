# 📘 Understanding JSON in Go: A Complete Guide

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is one of the most common data formats used in web development, APIs, and modern applications. If you're interchanging data between a server to client, you have to understand JSON. As a Developer, understanding how your language handles JSON is essential for building real-world applications.

---

## 🧩 What is JSON?

**JSON** is a lightweight, text-based format for structuring data. It's language-independent, but it originated from JavaScript. It's widely used for data exchange between a client and a server in web applications.

**Example JSON:**

```go
{
  "name": "Hasib",
  "age": 25,
  "skills": ["Go", "JavaScript"]
}
```

---

## 🚀 JSON Use Cases:

JSON is commonly used for:

* RESTful API request/response bodies
    
* Config files
    
* Data serialization/deserialization
    
* Inter-service communication, etc

### As a Go Developer, let's explore JSON in Go:

## 🛠️ JSON Implementation in Go

Go uses the `encoding/json` standard package to handle JSON. You can use two main approaches. First approach `Marshal`and `Unmarshal` They are used when you already have the full JSON data in memory. And the second approach `Encoder` and `Decoder` are used when you're working with **streams** (e.g, reading JSON from a file or HTTP body):

### 1\. `Marshal` and `Unmarshal`

Go is a static type language, so you can't write JSON directly. First, you need to create **a struct**. These functions `Marshal` and `Unmarshal` are used to **convert the structs to JSON (Marshal)** and **JSON to structs (Unmarshal)**.

#### 🔄 Let's see an example:(Struct ↔ JSON)

```go
type User struct {
	Name   string   `json:"name"`
	Age    int      `json:"age"`
	Skills []string `json:"skills"`
}
```

##### 🔹Struct to JSON

```go
// Struct to JSON
user := User{"Hasib", 25, []string{"Go", "JavaScript"}}

jsonData, _ := json.Marshal(user)
fmt.Println(string(jsonData)) 
	
//output: {"name":"Hasib","age":25,"skills":["Go","JavaScript"]}
```

##### 🔹JSON to Struct

```go
// JSON to Struct
jsonString := `{
	"name":"Hasib",
	"age":25,
	"skills":["Go","JavaScript"]
}`

var parsedUser User
json.Unmarshal([]byte(jsonString), &parsedUser)

fmt.Println(parsedUser.Name) 
//output: Hasib
```

---

### 2\. `Encoder` and `Decoder`

These are used for **streaming JSON** to and from I/O sources (e.g., HTTP requests/responses).

```go
// Reading JSON from HTTP request
json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&user)

// Writing JSON to HTTP response
json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(user)
```

These are especially useful in building web servers.

###### 📘 Note: I'm from a JavaScript background. JavaScript is my first language. So I had a little trouble understanding it at first. If you are already familiar with it, you can skip this section.

## 🔍 Comparison: JSON in Go vs JavaScript

| Feature | JavaScript | Go |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Structure | Dynamic object `{}` | Typed struct |
| Serialize Object | `JSON.stringify(obj)` | `json.Marshal(struct)` |
| Deserialize JSON | `JSON.parse(jsonString)` | `json.Unmarshal([]byte, &struct)` |
| JSON Tags | Not needed | Required: `json:"fieldName"` |
| Optional Fields | Can be missing | Use `omitempty`, pointer types, or default |
| Field Visibility | All fields visible | Must be exported (Capitalized fields) |
| Streaming (I/O) Support | Implicit in fetch/AJAX | Use `json.Encoder` / `json.Decoder` |

### 🔸 JS Object

```js
const user = { name: "Hasib", age: 25 };
```

### 🔹 Go Struct

```go
type User struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Age  int    `json:"age"`
}
```

---

## 🌐 Real-world REST API Example (in Go)

```go
func userHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.Method == http.MethodPost {
		var user User
		json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&user)
		json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]string{"message": "User created"})
	}
}
```

### 📌 Key Takeaways of Go JSON:

* Use `structs` with `json` tags for mapping JSON data.
    
* Use `Marshal`/`Unmarshal` for in-memory data.
    
* Use `Encoder`/`Decoder` for reading/writing to streams (like HTTP).
    
* Struct field names must be **exported** (start with uppercase) to be serialized. `public/privet` concept from OOP.
    

> Mastering JSON handling is your gateway to writing web servers, clients, and APIs in Go — and it's easier when you think of it like a type-safe version of JavaScript's object manipulation.

## ✅ Conclusion

Working with JSON in Go is simple and robust once you understand the basics of structs, field tags, and the `encoding/json` package. While Go is more strict and typed compared to JavaScript, this makes your data structures more predictable and secure.
